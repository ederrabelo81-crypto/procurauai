Wait, let me reconsider. The only modified file is `src/pages/BusinessDetail.tsx`, which is a TypeScript React component file (source code). There are no build artifacts, dependency directories, or temporary files in the changes list that need to be ignored.

Since the changes contain only source files (.tsx), no additional ignores are needed beyond what might already be reasonable to preserve.

Actually, looking again - there are no added or deleted files, only a modified source file. No build artifacts or dependencies are present in the changes. Following rule #6, if the change list contains only source files and no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, I should output nothing.
